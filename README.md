# COVID GRAPHMAKER
This is the graphmaker code used for making the COVID-19 data graphs as seen in the "Safe In School COVID-19" YouTube channel.

<br />
# use - just tell me
This is code written by me, and is free for non-commercial uses only, with proper credits. <br />
Also, send me a short email about where you are using the code. <br />
Please do not copywrite this code. Do not use it until you have contacted me and I respond. <br />
Thank you for your consideration. <br />

# mission - why am I doing this?
The main motive behind my COVID YouTube channel and the COVID Graphmaker is that **Necessary information should be free, fast, and accessible, INCLUDING the means of redistribution.** <br />
I have attempted and still continue my efforts to select the correct information and distribute it on my YouTube channel. <br />
Now *redistribution* was a different issue, and this is my solution.
<br />
This code is compact and does not require a computer with high computing power. (To put in perspective, any school-provided computer/laptop should be able to run this without any issues.) <br />
The cost is free. The code uses absolutely nothing that requires a monetary purchase.
<br />
<br />
# future development - maybe even an app (pending)
I realize that many people aren't familiar with coding languages. I used Python for this since it is currently a very popular language and thus more people would be able to approach it. <br />
But to me, it's not enough. What about the general public? How would they use this? <br />
On the other hand, if it becomes too easy, would that spur misinformation through abuse of the program? <br />
<br />
<br />
**I will be updating the YouTube page more often now that this project is ending. <br />
Expect more short enjoyable COVID information videos! <br />
Thank You! <br />

# THE MANUAL

# difficulty
I must admit, this took quite some time to make since I came up with this project before I knew much Python. <br />
Now, if you know Python already, then it should be ok. <br />
But if you don't, please at least look at the free basic tutorials online, which I believe, should be enough. <br />
<br />
I have comments in the code showing which steps do what. I hope you find it helpful.

# instructions
  1. Hardware Requirements <br />
    *This code was written on MacOS. Please consider that there may be discrepancies or issues when using Windows.* <br />
    A computer. That's it.
    
  2. Software Requirements <br />
    Python: You should have Python 3 installed on your computer. (preferably the latest version of python) <br />
    Plotly: Plotly should be installed. <br />
    pandas: pandas are cute, but they cannot be installed on your computer. Make sure you have/are installing the 'Python library' named pandas. <br />
    Webdriver: The Chrome Webdriver should be installed. <br />
    Selenium: Selenium WebDriver should be installed. <br />
    
    You may or may not have conda. If you know what that is, I am assuming you know what you are doing; but just to be safe, pandas is the sum of numpy, scipy, and 
    matplotlib, none of which are individually necessary for the code, but pandas as a whole is. At least, that's how I wrote it.
    
  3. Running the Code <br />
    -----PLEASE!----- <br />
    READ THE CODE BEFORE RUNNING THEM. THIS IS CRUCIAL. <br />
    The code runs on the assumption that certain folders are located and named correctly. <br />
    Please follow this or edit to fit your computer.

  4. Order <br />
    1) Run 'new_cdc_webscrap_and_statestrf.py'.   When done, <br />
    2) Run 'per_state_date_strf.py'.              When done, <br />
    3) Run 'plotly_auto_diff_graphmaker.py'.      Review images. <br />
    4) End.
